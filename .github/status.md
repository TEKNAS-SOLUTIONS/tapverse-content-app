# Development Status

## Current Step: Database Setup

**Status:** ⏳ Waiting for PostgreSQL installation

**What's needed:**
- Run `./setup-complete.sh` to install PostgreSQL and set up database
- Once tests pass, we can proceed to the next step

**TDD Approach:**
- ✅ Test structure created
- ⏳ Database setup (tests will pass after setup)
- ⏳ Next: Client & Project Management (with tests)
